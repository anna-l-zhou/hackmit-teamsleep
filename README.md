# hackMIT: nap stars!
Insomniacs, oversleepers, and tired people alike! Welcome, let us all become nap STARS! 

## Inspiration
Contrary to popular belief, it is _not_ healthy to brag about how little sleep you are getting. We decided to change that by turning sleep into a healthy competition. Getting better sleep is something we all want to do, but it can be difficult when actually trying to go through with it. Inspired by apps like Snapchat and Duolingo that implement competitive streak systems for consistent use, we thought that adding an element of competition with both yourself and other people would be a great way to motivate people to sleep more consistently.

## What it does
Our website helps you view your sleep tracking data obtained from your smart watch, a sleeping device, or use a manual stopwatch to determine how many hours you are sleeping per night, as well as how you compare to others on their sleeping journey. Our goal of the production stage of the app is to include small meditations, a sleep journal, and machine learning to adequately estimate exactly how much sleep each person needs. If the user sleeps 8 or more hours a night, their streak will increase by 1. If not, they will lose their streak and have to start all over again. They will be able to compare themselves against both a global leaderboard, and their friends' streaks as well.

## How we built it
For our prototype, we decided to build a Flask webapp instead of a mobile app due to the time constraint. We stored account and sleep history data inside a SQLite database, and designed the front-end with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jinja.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time working with databases so many of our team members struggled to work around issues once they came up, We were almost all unfamiliar with Flask as well, so downloading the appropriate libraries and figuring out its syntax was a bit of a struggle that hindered fast progress, but we overcame both with mentor help and by helping each other!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even submitting! We know it takes great guts and courage to meet new people and form a team, even more to actually develop that idea, and a lot to submit at such a prestigious institution like MIT. But it's the journey that counts! Sure winning is fun, but it's not about the prize money; it's the friends and knowledge you won along the way.

## What we learned
Working as a team, Flask, figma, web design, logo design, SQLite, databases, and more!

## What's next for Nap Stars
Making a responsive app, and fully executing all our features! Our current design is a very bare-bones prototype, so making sure all our basic features are in place, transferring to an app format, and adding the additional features mentioned above would be crucial in bringing our vision to life.
