## How we built it
We used Flask, a technology new to most of us, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. A SQLite database was used to store logins.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even submitting! We know it takes great guts and courage to meet new people and form a team, even more to actually develop that idea, and a lot to submit at such a prestigious institution like MIT. But it's the journey that counts! Sure winning is fun, but it's not about the prize money; it's the friends and knowledge you won along the way.
